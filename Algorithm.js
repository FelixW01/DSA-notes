// Algorithm:
// A Process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

// Game plan for solving a problem
// 1. Understand the problem
// 2. Explore concrete examples
// 3. Break it down
// 4. Solve/Simplify
// 5. Look back and refactor

// Understand the problem
// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// Can I restate the problems in my own words?
// Implement addition
// 2. What are some inputs that og into the problem?
// ints?
// floats?
// what about string for large numbers?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// int? float? string?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
